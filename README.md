# minesweeper
Self-explanatory title.

## How to play
Pretty weird if you have to read this.

There are forty mines scattered across this grid. Right click to uncover a squareâ€”"X" are mines, the number on the square indicates the number of mines in adjacent squares, and blank squares imply no neighobing mines. Right clicking an uncovered square flags it as a mine. Flag all forty to win.

## etc.
Using Angular might've been extra, but I learned a lot. Hardest part was probably wrestling with ```angular-cli-ghpages``` but it turned out alright!
