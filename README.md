# minesweeper
Self-explanatory title. Check it out [here](https://vishvak-ravi.github.io/minesweeper/).

## How to play
Pretty weird if you have to read this.

There are forty mines scattered across this grid. Right click to uncover a square—"X" are mines, the number on the square indicates the number of mines in adjacent squares, and blank squares imply no neighobing mines. Right clicking an uncovered square flags it as a mine. Flag all forty to win.


## etc.
Vanilla Javascript was probably enough, but I learned a lot with Angular. Heard a lot about web dev frameworks and thought it'd be a leraning experience. Hardest part was probably wrestling with ```angular-cli-ghpages``` but it turned out alright! The recursive grid-based algorithms were fun to implement. Doing the basic design was kinda cool, so might come around to learning Sass properly. Angular is cool but overall experience was 6/10—Sass sounds fun to do.
